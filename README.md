# BounceBall
Bounce Ball game

Just a small prototype coded in LibGDX. The idea is you tilt the floor tiles to bounce the ball around to hit the targets (the suspended blocks).  

Use the arrow keys to tilt the floor tiles.

Post mortem:  it turns out to be too tricky to steer the ball like this.  Also it is hard to judge the bounce direction in 3d.
